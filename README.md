## Description

For this assignment I created the back end for an E-commerce webpage. This project allows users to view, update, add, and delete categories, tags, and products. This portion of the website is important because it allows you to add or remove items from your store without hard coding it into your webpage every time something is added or dropped. My motivation behind this assignment was to make E-commerce easier to update and keep track of.

## Installation

In order to install this assignment you first download all my assets from gitHub. Once downloaded you will need to do "NPM I" to download all the dependencies. After that you will need to source the database by signing in the mysql and running "source schema.db. Then you will need to seed that database by running "npm run seed" Once those steps are finished you simply run "NPM start" and you are ready to go!

## Usage

To use this project one must first install insomnia. Once insomnia is installed you simply just add your route and do any kind of call you would like to make.
